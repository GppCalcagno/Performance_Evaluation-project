# :abacus: Performance Evaluation - Project
This is the repository for the projects of Performance Evaluation and Application  course held at [Polimi](https://www.polimi.it/).

Performance Evaluation is the quantitative and qualitative study of  systems, to evaluate, measure, predict and ensure target 
behaviors and performances. The main topics of the course are:
* Introduction to performance indices and measures
* Workload and Service characterization
* Analytical models
* Simulation and resource contention

The coverage of this topics was done through the development of 20 assignment and a final project to put in practice all the knowledge acquired. 

üõ†Ô∏è All the projects were developed in [MatLab](https://it.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and Java Modeling Tool ([JMT](https://jmt.sourceforge.net/)).

### :alarm_clock: Assignment
In the relative folder all the 20 assignments are present. For each assignment a Matlab\JMT application is present with the source code and the relative pdf file with the task specification. Sometimes a dataset is provided.

---
### :keyboard: Final Project
The final project is a analysis of a embedded system development cycle, where  the company need to know best number of projects N that  they should work on at the same time, to produce the best tradeoff  between throughput and project completion time mixing all the knowledge acquired during the course. 

The project is divided using both Matlab and JMT. In the relative folder is present:
* The specification of the project ([pdf](https://github.com/GppCalcagno/Performance_Evaluation-project/blob/main/project/Projects%202022-2023.pdf))
* 2 matlab project used for data analysis
* JMT project used for the simulation of the system ([jmt](https://github.com/GppCalcagno/Performance_Evaluation-project/blob/main/project/JML%20-%20ProjectModel.jsimg))
* The final report of the project ([pdf](https://github.com/GppCalcagno/Performance_Evaluation-project/blob/main/project/Project%20Presentation.pdf))
* A folder with the dataset used for the project
